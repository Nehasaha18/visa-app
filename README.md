Key Capabilities

- Visa Approval Prediction
  Utilizes trained ML models to estimate the probability of visa acceptance based on applicant profiles, visa category, and past trends.

- Processing Time Estimation
  Calculates expected processing days using statistical modelling, allowing applicants to plan their timelines more effectively.

- Data Validation & Cleaning
  Automatically handles missing values, date inconsistencies, and data-format issues to ensure reliable predictions.

- Visual Analytics
  Generates interactive charts and trend insights for better understanding of visa behaviour across regions and years.

- Country & Visa-Type Insights
  Offers comparative analysis of processing speeds and decision patterns for different countries and visa categories.

This project aims to simplify the visa process by providing transparent, AI-assisted predictions, helping users make informed decisions while reducing uncertainty. 
It can be integrated into academic research, advisory services, or personal application planning tools.
